Search::Z3950
=============

Simple Z39.50 searching for ordinary folk.

See the POD documentation for details.


INSTALLING
----------

Follow the usual Perl module installation process:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install

NOTE: When you run `make test', Search::Z3950 will, by default, contact the
(U.S.A.) Library of Congress's Z39.50 server.  To choose a different server
to use in testing, run `perl Makefile.PL --interact' instead of just
`perl Makefile.PL'.  You will then be able to choose from a list of servers.

WARNING: Unfortunately, testing against other servers may result in failure,
because I haven't tested the tests themselves to make sure the proper queries
are sent!
